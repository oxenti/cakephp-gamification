## Installation

this repository should be installed in the same way as any other plugin.

# Database
We're working on it but for now, you need to create the plugins table on your own.

Follow this model



You can files in `Gamification/Migrations` if you use Migrations plugin

## Use it

Simply add this to each model you want to be `gamificable`.

Currently support `Add` / `Edit` / `Delete` action

    // app/Model/SampleModel.php
      class SampleModel extends AppModel {

    	public $actsAs = array(
    	    'Gamification.Gamificable' => array(
                'rules' => array(
                	array(
                		'action' => 'Add',
                		'points' => 20,
                		'occurence' => 1
                	),
                	array(
                		'action' => 'Edit',
                		'points' => 10,
                		'occurence' => 1
                	),
                	array(
                		'action' => 'Delete',
                		'points' => 5,
                		'occurence' => 1
                	)
                )
    	    )
        );

        // Whatever your class do
      }
